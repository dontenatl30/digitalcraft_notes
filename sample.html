    <h1>LaDonte LeBlanc</h1>
            <div> I was Born in Atlanta, GA. but had the misfortune of growing up in Oklahoma.
            I love looking at achitecture and and home floor plans. I hope to one day soon own my own home.
            I also hope to continue to increase my knowledge in technology and IT in order to maintain a lucrative seond stream of income.
            I'm currently an Insurance adjuster. Though, i do feel as though ive found my calling,
            I feel in life people can have more than one. while this class may be challanging,
            I feel if i really stick with it, it can be very rewarding. </div>
